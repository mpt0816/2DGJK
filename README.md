# GJK
A implemenation of GJK algorithm to solve the collision detection, distance query and witness points problems in 2D.
The implemenation follows the description presented in "Barycode-based GJK Algorithm". 
Divide the problems to three levels:
- Level 1: binary result, collide or not
- Level 2: distance scalar
- Level 3: distance, complete witness points and separating direction
